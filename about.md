### About:

<img alt="Ian Reah" src="../images/ian-reah.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">

I am currently working as a Software Developer at [Nonlinear Dynamics Limited](http://nonlinear.com/), a developer of proteomics and metabolomics software.

My day job mainly involves developing Windows desktop applications with C# .NET.

My hobby/spare-time development therefore tends to focus on playing around with some different technologies (which, at the minute seems to be web application development with JavaScript).

It's this hobby/spare-time development that you're most likely to read about here.
